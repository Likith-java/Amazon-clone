### Amazon Clone Projects

This repository contains code for two separate Amazon clone projects, each demonstrating different levels of complexity in web development using HTML and CSS.

### Project 1: Full Amazon Clone

This project is a detailed clone of the Amazon home page. It includes a navigation bar, a hero section, multiple product category boxes, and a comprehensive footer, showcasing an advanced understanding of modern web page layout and styling.

#### Files

* **`index.html`**: The main HTML file for the project. It structures the entire page, from the header and navigation bar to the main content and a multi-section footer. It includes links to the stylesheet and external icon libraries.
* **`style.css`**: The primary stylesheet for the project. It provides the visual design for the entire page, including the layout, colors, font styles, and hover effects. It organizes the styles using a clear class-based structure.
* **Image Assets**: The various image files (`hero_image.jpg`, `box1_image.jpg`, `amazon_logo.png`, etc.) are used to populate the hero section, product category boxes, and the site's logo, making the clone visually authentic.

### Project 2: Basic Amazon Clone

This is a simplified, foundational project that mimics the basic layout of an Amazon page. It's a great starting point for learning how to structure and style a simple webpage.

#### Files

* **`2.html`**: The HTML file for the basic clone. It contains a minimalist structure with a simple navigation bar and a logo image.
* **`2.css`**: This CSS file provides basic styling for the navigation bar and the logo, demonstrating how to use IDs to select and style elements.
* **Image Asset**: The `amazon_logo.png` file is used to display the logo in the navigation bar.
